Ciao! I'm Andreas De Rosi, a fun-loving Italian who's been on quite the international adventure! 🇮🇹 My journey began with studying in Austria and England, and eventually, I found myself living in India for an entire decade! 🇦🇹🇬🇧🇮🇳

Nowadays, I split my time between Berlin, India, and the occasional trip to Chiang Mai, Thailand. It's not just about the holidays, though! Chiang Mai is a fantastic place where I can connect with my SEO peers and collaborate on exciting projects. 🇹🇭💻

While my career initially focused on market research and trade promotion between the EU and India, I've recently shifted gears. Over the last 5 years, I've been pouring my heart into developing niche content websites. 🚀

Speaking of which, let me introduce you to my two current projects! 🌟

I'm always excited to learn and grow, and I can't wait to see what new opportunities await. My life has been a whirlwind of experiences, and I'm grateful for the fantastic people I've met along the way. I hope my content inspires you and sparks your curiosity. ✨
